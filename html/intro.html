<B><U>Introducing the SockHop system</U></B>

<P>SockHop is a system that facilitates the development of BeOS applications
that run on many machines at once.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is implemented in a single
file (libsockhop.so) that serves as both shared library for client code,
and as a server program for remote program invocation and control.&nbsp; SockHop's
primary design goals are <I>ease of use</I>, <I>flexibility</I>, and <I>scalability</I>.&nbsp;
Using SockHop, writing and debugging a BeOS program that runs on many machines
at once is not much harder than writing a "regular" multithreaded BeOS
program.

<P><B><U>Features that SockHop currently supports</U></B>
<UL>
<LI>
Creates and connects together any number of teams on any number of BeOS
machines into a "virtual network".&nbsp; The virtual network's topology
is that of an arbitrary tree, with user threads and messaging threads running
on each node on the tree.&nbsp; This tree configuration allows the virtual
network to scale to tens of thousands of machines. (in theory, at least;
I haven't tested this ;))</LI>

<LI>
Routes, multicasts, and broadcasts BMessages up and down the tree according
to addressing info they contain.&nbsp; The default routing algorithm uses
a powerful <A HREF="wi1dpath.html">node-path regular expression wildcarding</A>
scheme, or you can <A HREF="sorters.html">supply your own routing methods</A>
via add-ons.&nbsp; You can specify a different routing algorithm for each
node on the network, or even specify per BMessage which algorithm should
be used.</LI>

<LI>
In addition to the standard tree-based routing, any node may create a "<A HREF="sh_commands.html#addcomponents">symlink</A>"
to any other node in the tree, allowing it to send BMessages directly to
that node for better performance.</LI>

<LI>
Automatically distributes and caches executable code and data files to
every node on the virtual network that needs them.&nbsp; Once you have
installed and executed libsockhop.so on all the involved machines, you
only need to deal with the one "root machine" that you do your compiling
on;&nbsp; SockHop will automatically handle all the rest.</LI>

<LI>
Convenient utility classes are provided for accepting and creating TCP
connections that link your code with programs running outside of the node
tree.</LI>

<LI>
Handles heterogeneous networks, making sure that each machine in the virtual
network gets the appropriate files for its architecture.&nbsp; (e.g. Intel
executables go to the Intel machines, PowerPC code goes to Macs and BeBoxes,
platform-neutral data files go to machines of any hardware architecture,
etc)</LI>

<LI>
Includes a simple password-based security policy, or you can write your
own security policy as an add-on for more peace of mind.</LI>

<LI>
Loads user-written add-ons to instantiate and propagates <A HREF="workers.html">"live"
objects</A> over the virtual network.&nbsp; Want your worker object running
on every computer in the lab?&nbsp; Just Archive() it up into a BMessage
and broadcast it!</LI>

<LI>
Uses a simple yet flexible BMessage-based API that integrates well with
the "Be Philosophy".&nbsp; With this API, common tasks like setting up
the virtual network, propagating code, and multicasting or broadcasting
BMessages to various nodes are dead easy, more complicated things like
intelligent error handling and synchronization are only a little bit harder,
and really cool things like threads that "roam the network" or dynamic
network reconfiguration are also straightforward.</LI>

<LI>
Guaranteed clean system shutdowns.&nbsp; When your root program terminates
(either intentionally or because of a crash or CTRL-C), all other nodes
on the virtual network automatically shut down and exit cleanly.</LI>

<LI>
100% Multithreaded, asynchronous design for efficiency.</LI>

<LI>
Each remote node is created in its own address space, so you won't have
to restart any of your <A HREF="sockhopserver.html">SockHop server processes</A>
every time the add-on you are developing crashes.</LI>

<LI>
libsockhop.so is open-sourced under the GNU Public License (GPL), so you
have easy access to its source code if you need it.&nbsp; The other parts
of the SockHop package (SockDemo, etc) are in the Public Domain.</LI>
</UL>
<B><U>Features that will be added to SockHop in a subsequent release</U></B>
<UL>
<LI>
Ability to use UDP and/or Ethernet broadcast packets for more efficient
one-to-many transmission.</LI>

<LI>
Optimize handling of BMessages (use more reference counting and less data
copying).</LI>

<LI>
Optional GUI for the SockHop server.</LI>

<LI>
More example programs and diagnostic tools.</LI>
</UL>
<B><U>Potential Features (ideas that may or may not be implemented)</U></B>
<UL>
<LI>
Hooks into the BeOS scripting architecture for easy remote machine control.</LI>

<LI>
A collection of handy included SHWorker and SHSorter subclass add-ons.</LI>

<LI>
A collection of wrappers/utility functions that further simplify common
tasks.</LI>

<LI>
Some sort of "virtual network configuration manager", into which the user
could enter relevant information about all the computers that may be used
in the SockHop tree.&nbsp; SockHop programs could then access this database
for configuration info, instead of having to get this information "manually"
from the user or a config file.</LI>

<LI>
Data streaming.&nbsp;&nbsp; (for things like video broadcasting, and just
for more memory-efficient transmission of large BMessages)</LI>
</UL>
<B><U>Note on Internet Usage</U></B>

<P>Although SockHop will work over the Internet (it uses regular old TCP
connections), it was not designed with general Internet usage as a priority.&nbsp;
Before using SockHop as the base for a general-use Internet app, consider
the following:
<UL>
<LI>
One of the things a SockHopServer does is download (to potentially any
location in the filesystem!) and execute arbitrary C++ code.&nbsp; This
makes SockHop a potentially <B>BIG SECURITY HOLE</B>--an easy target for
spreading viruses, trojan horses and other nastiness.&nbsp; The SockHopServer
can (and should) be set to require a password from clients before it will
start a session, but nonetheless running a SockHopServer that is accessible
to the entire Internet might not be such a wise idea.&nbsp; (Note also
that passwords are currently passed over the net as plaintext!!!)</LI>
</UL>
If you have suggestions on how SockHop might be made more secure or amenable
to running over "the wild untamed Internet",&nbsp; please email me; I'd
love to hear them.&nbsp; (Of course, the *real* solution for this problem
has been implemented and it's called Java; but Java has its own set of
limitations, and anyway I am NOT about to write my own JVM!&nbsp; ;))
