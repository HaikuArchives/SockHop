<P>This SockHop archive comes complete with the library/server binary,
documentation, example programs, and example code.
<BR>The directory structure that will be installed is listed below.

<P>The main demo included in this archive is called SockDemo, and can be
found in the SockDemo subdirectory.&nbsp; It demonstrates most of libsockhop.so's
capabilities, including automatic code propagation, process management,
and message passing.&nbsp; See the README file in the SockDemo directory
for information on how to run it.&nbsp; SockDemo also comes with source
code to peruse.

<P>Other things to look at are the SimpleTest and ExampleClasses directories--SimpleTest
is a shell-based program that demonstrates very basic SockHop functionality--creating
and connecting to nodes on a SockHop tree, and caching files on them.&nbsp;
The ExampleClasses directory contains examples of <A HREF="sorters.html">SHSorter</A>,
<A HREF="workers.html">SHWorker</A>, and <A HREF="accesspolicy.html">SHAccessPolicy</A>
subclasses that can be modified for use in your own programs.
