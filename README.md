SockHop
================
v1.13 Beta source code
Released March 20, 1999  
Copyright 1999, Jeremy Friesner (jfriesne@ucsd.edu)  

This archive contains the source code for libsockhop.so version 1.13Beta.
libsockhop.so's source code is all covered by the Gnu Library Public License
(see the included COPYING.html file for details).  There is also a "tests"
directory that contains some trivial testing programs that I have been
using to validate libsockhop.so with.  These testing programs are all
placed in the public domain.  

This is a source code archive only; it contains no executable files.
The run-time SockHop distribution contains the precompiled libraries
and demo programs, and can be found on BeWare or on my web page
at http://www-wilson.ucsd.edu/~jaf.  Note that the run time archive
also contains some demo source (SockDemo) that is not included in this 
archive.
