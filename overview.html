<P>One of the nicest things about BeOS is its elegant support for symmetric
multiprocessing.&nbsp; With SMP, it's easy to write programs that take
advantage of the combined power of two, four, or even eight CPU's running
on the same computer.&nbsp; But why stop there?&nbsp; Wouldn't it be great
to run your program on 16 CPUs in parallel?&nbsp; Or 128?&nbsp; Or 512?&nbsp;
Sure it would!&nbsp; With that much CPU power, you could write programs
to do things that were never possible before.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, due
to the memory&nbsp; bandwidth limitations of SMP, you're not likely to
see BeOS running on a 512-CPU (or even a 16-CPU) machine any time soon.

<P>But there is nonetheless a way to achieve such massive parallelism under
BeOS.&nbsp; All you need to do is network a group of BeOS machines together,
and have them all act as part of a single "virtual computer", with each
computer running a different part of your program.&nbsp; Instead of paying
an arm and a leg for some monstrously expensive 64-CPU machine, you could
just buy 16 4-CPU machines, and some Ethernet cards.&nbsp; Cheap(er) and
easy, right?

<P>Well, it should be easy.&nbsp; Until now, though, it hasn't always been
so.&nbsp; The idea is straightforward enough, but software inflexibility
and mundane implementation details get in the way, making development of
programs that span multiple machines difficult, tedious, and error-prone.&nbsp;
Before you could even start working on your program's real task, you'd
have to write networking and synchronization code to link all the machines
together, and very likely during development you'd run into mysterious
problems because the various machines weren't quite compatible, or some
of the machines were still running an old version of your software (because
you had forgot to update them after your last compile), or your network
would become a bottleneck, robbing you of performance, or...

<P><B><U>SockHop</U></B>

<P>SockHop is a package which solves these problems for you.&nbsp; You
just install and run libsockhop.so on each machine on your network, and
after that your programs(*) can use all the BeOS machines on your network
almost as if they were one single gargantuan machine.&nbsp; SockHop automatically
starts, stops, and manages processes on each of the various machines for
you, handles the inter-computer message routing and broadcasting, automatically
propagates the newest versions of your code and data to the computers that
need it, and even allows you to run your program on a mix of Intel and
PowerPC BeOS systems at once.&nbsp; Furthermore, SockHop is designed in
such a way that your virtual machine can scale geometrically in size, from
one machine to dozens, hundreds, or even thousands.&nbsp; But if you can't
afford to buy thousands of PCs just yet, you can develop and debug your
multi-CPU program on just one machine, and when it's done you will be able
to deploy it on a large scale, with almost no changes to your code.&nbsp;
All this is implemented using a simple, powerful, easy-to-learn BMessage
based API, and an internal architecture that takes full advantage of Be's
state-of-the-art multithreading, networking, and run-time code linking
capabilities.

<P>*(Programs that are written to use libsockhop.so, that is)
