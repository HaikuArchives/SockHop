<B><U>How to manually install SockHop</U></B>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To install SockHop automatically, just unzip
the SockHop archive and run Install_SockHop.sh from a Terminal window.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To install SockHop by hand, the following
steps must be taken:
<UL>
<LI>
Copy the file SockHop/libsockhop.so.x86 (or SockHop/libsockhop.so.ppc)
to /boot/home/config/lib.</LI>

<LI>
If you want to start the accepting SockHop connections right away, run
libsockhop.so (yes, that's right, execute the library file!) in a shell.&nbsp;
Doing so will start up a SockHop server on your machine.&nbsp; For more
instructions on command line parameters, and how to use the SockHop server,
look <A HREF="sockhopserver.html">here</A>. If you want the SockHop server
to be automatically launched on startup, you can put it in your UserBootScript
(be sure to have it run in the background, be sure you know the security
issues involved, and be sure its current directory is okay to write files
onto!)</LI>
</UL>


<P>Also:&nbsp; If the computer you are installing to is to be used to compile
SockHop programs, you should copy the include directory SockHop/include/sockhop
to somewhere convenient (perhaps to /develop/headers).&nbsp; The "sockhop"
directory contains all the .h files you will need to use SockHop classes.
